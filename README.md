# Acquios Feedback Form

This repository contains the HTML and CSS for a feedback form designed for Acquios. It allows users to provide their personal information, rate their overall experience, and evaluate a representative's qualities using checkboxes.

## Features

### Personal Information
- **First Name**: Required input for the user's first name.
- **Last Name**: Required input for the user's last name.
- **Email Address**: Required input for the user's email address.

### Rating System
- **Star Rating**: Users can rate their overall experience with up to five stars. Four stars are filled with a color to indicate a rating, and one star is empty, showing that the rating can be partial.

### Representative Evaluation
- **Checkboxes**: Users can check all the qualities that they believe describe the representative from the following options:
    - Professional and courteous
    - Knowledgeable
    - Friendly
    - Efficient
    - Patient
    - Warm and respectful
    - Clear and direct

### Submit Button
- A button at the bottom allows users to submit their feedback.

## How It Works

### HTML Structure:
- **Form Elements**: Includes text inputs for the user's personal information, email address, and multiple checkboxes for rating the representative.
- **Rating**: The star icons represent the user's rating of their overall experience.
- **Checkboxes**: The form allows users to select multiple characteristics of the representative they interacted with.

### CSS Styling:
- **Form Layout**: The form uses a grid layout with two columns to align the input fields properly.
- **Button Styling**: The submit button is styled with a background color (`#fd7c4d`), matching the theme.
- **Icons**: Font Awesome icons are used for the star rating and the Acquios logo.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the feedback form, including input fields, checkboxes, and buttons.
